The CMD line in the Dockerfile determines parameters passed to Deno.

```
CMD ["run", "--allow-net", "main.ts"]
```

Note: That the listen port (1993), must match with the EXPOSED port in the
Dockerfile.

Run using the build and run commands (you may want to use a more descriptive
name than `app`):

```sh
$ docker build -t app . && docker run -it --init -p 1993:1993 app
```

In another terminal or browser you can access:

```sh
$ curl localhost:1993
Hello World
```
